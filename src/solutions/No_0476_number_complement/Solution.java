 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * Note:
 * The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: 1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

 * 解题思路:
 * 其实就是求原数字与二进制的1111...(位数与原数字二进制位数相同)的异或值
